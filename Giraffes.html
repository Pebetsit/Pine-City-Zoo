            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
            <p>
                The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its
                leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs,
                its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family
                Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by
                their coat patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
                The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from
                Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open
                woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other
                herbivores cannot reach.
            </p>

            <p>
                Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas, and African
                wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations
                if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through
                "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access
                to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.

                You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.
