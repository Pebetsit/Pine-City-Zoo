            <h3>PANDAS</h3>

            <p>
                The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to
                south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes,
                over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it
                from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over
                99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in
                the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub
                leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
            </p>

            <p>
                The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in
                neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other
                development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

            <p>
                The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.
